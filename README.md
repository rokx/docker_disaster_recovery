# Docker disaster recovery scripts

In this repository you can find scripts to backup your docker data to an active DR location.

All data on DR location will be overwriten.

Because of rsync the data synchronization happens verfy fast. Minimum downtime.

Tested on simple setup of two docker standalone installations.
